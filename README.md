# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-and-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of various machine learning and deep learning models for detecting credit card fraud. The study emphasizes novel feature engineering techniques, handling imbalanced data, model interpretability, and the impact of threshold tuning on the models' performance.
Objectives:

Comparative analysis of machine learning and deep learning models under identical conditions.
Evaluation of novel feature engineering techniques on model effectiveness.
Strategies for handling imbalanced data in credit card fraud detection.
Analysis of model interpretability in the banking sector.
Impact of classification threshold variation on model performance.
Key Findings:

Tree-Based Models: Showed high accuracy but potential overfitting due to class imbalance.
Logistic Regression: High accuracy in identifying non-fraudulent transactions but less effective for fraudulent ones.
Deep Learning Models: High accuracy with challenges in precision and recall for fraudulent transactions.
SVM: Balanced precision and recall, with slightly lower accuracy but high recall for fraudulent transactions.
Feature Engineering: Varied effects on different models, with some showing performance improvements and others a decline, especially in deep learning models.
Imbalanced Data Handling: SMOTE effectively improved performance, particularly for models affected by class imbalance.
Model Interpretability: Traditional models provided clear insights, while deep learning models posed challenges despite high accuracy.
Threshold Tuning: Crucial for optimizing model performance, enhancing fraud detection capabilities.
Conclusions:
The project underlines the importance of model selection based on specific fraud detection requirements. It highlights the role of precision-recall trade-offs, model interpretability, feature engineering, and threshold adjustments in model performance.

Implications:
This research advances the understanding of credit card fraud detection, offering insights for practical applications in the banking industry and guiding the selection and optimization of models for similar tasks.
